# About this repository
This is the GitHub repository for the 2021 SAS Global Forum paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Legacy SAS® and SAS® Viya® in the Cloud at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid."
There are two files in this repository. 
	1. CMS Covid-19 Nurisng Home ETL and ML Pipeline.ipynb
	2. COVID_19_NURSING_HOME_DATASET3F5_v2.csv

## Acknowledgements
The authors would like to thank our colleagues for their support and assistance while writing this paper. There are too many to mention but the following individuals, in particular, contributed a lot of their technical and analytic insights while writing this paper: Gene Grabowski, Timo Kettunen, Deva Kumar, John Stultz, and Jonathan Walker. Our partners at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College (Rema Padman, Alexandra Allen, Anzhi Mou, Zhaoyu Qiao, Harvir Singh Virk, Xiaoyu Zhu) showed us innovative, influential and inspiring work with Python and SAS Viya that served as the foundation for some of the topics in this paper. Oscar Heller, Sofia Heller, Alexandria Adams, Benjamin Lannis provided valuable research assistance and insights during early iterations of the conference paper through their data science and storytelling contributions around nursing homes and even opioids. In addition, as always, Kim Andrews for her tireless efforts with all things SAS
